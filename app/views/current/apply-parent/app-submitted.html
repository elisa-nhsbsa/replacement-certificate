        <p>Thank you for applying for a <strong>Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC)</strong>.</p>

        <!-- <p>We have sent a confirmation email to <strong>{{ data['your-email-address'] }}</strong> to let you know that we have received your application. It can take a few minutes for the email to arrive. If it doesn't arrive in 24 hours, check your spam or junk folder. -->

        <h2>What happens next</h2>

        <p>We’ll use the details you’ve given us to check that {{ data[‘child-firstname’] }} is entitled to a PRC. To do this, we’ll need to run a residency check to confirm your residency in the UK. This is not an identity check or a credit check, and it will not affect your credit score.</p>

        <p>You’ll then receive an email from us shortly to either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>let you know that this application has been successful</li>
          <li>ask for more evidence to help support this application</li>
        </ul> 
        

        <p>If the application is successful, we’ll email the PRC to where {{ data[‘child-firstname’] }} has had treatment. When the treatment provider receives it, they can work out which costs can be covered. We’ll also email you a copy for reference.</p>
        <p>It should only take a few minutes for this email to arrive, but it may take up to 24 hours. You may need to check your spam or junk folder.</p>

        <h2>What a PRC covers</h2>

        <p>A PRC provides the same cover as what would normally be covered by an existing European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC), or UK European Health Insurance Card (UK EHIC).</p>

        <p>This means that {{ data[‘child-firstname’] }} will be covered for emergency treatment costs as if they were a resident of that country.</p>
        <p>For more information on what is covered in different countries, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">check the guidance on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

        <h3>What is not covered</h3>

        <p>Most treatment costs are covered by a PRC, but there are some exceptions. </p>
        <p>In some countries, a resident of that country may have to pay towards the cost of their treatment. This would typically be for services like GP or dentist consultations, prescriptions, or hospital stays.</p>
        <p>This is known as a co-payment or a patient contribution. </p>
        <p>Depending on the country, you may still need to pay for services that would normally be free on the NHS.</p>
        <p>You may still receive an invoice for a co-payment if you have not paid one already.</p>

          <p>A PRC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs</p>

        You cannot use this service to apply for a PRC as you’ve told us that the person you’re applying on behalf of has paid more than a co-payment or patient contribution for their treatment.

      <h2>Claiming a refund</h2>

      <p>Depending on the country, a visitor may be expected to pay for all or part of the bill upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.</p>
      
      <p>They can claim back the difference between the total bill and the co-payment, but the actual co-payment is not refundable.</p>
      <p>They should keep all invoices, receipts, and any other paperwork. They or their insurance company may need them to apply for a refund.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us">Contact us to claim a refund</a>. </p>

        <h2>What happens next</h2>

        <!-- <h3>Your application</h3> -->

        <ul>
          <li>We'll check your entitlement using the details you've given us in your application. </li>
          <li>If you've told us that you live in the UK, we'll run a check to confirm your residency. This is not an identity check or a credit check, and it will not affect your credit score.</li>
          <li>If your application is successful, we'll send your PRC to the treatment facilities at the email addresses you've provided. We'll also send a copy of this to you. </li>
          <li>If we need more information to help with your application, we may email you to ask for evidence.</li>
          <li>It may take a few minutes for this email to arrive. If you've not received this in 24 hours, check your spam or junk folder. </li>
        </ul>  

        <h2>What your PRC covers</h2>

        <p>A PRC provides the same cover as what would normally be covered by an existing European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC), or UK European Health Insurance Card (UK EHIC).</p>
        <p>Your PRC is valid for 28 days from when your treatment started. If you need cover for longer than this, you'll need to re-apply.</p>

        <h3>What it does not cover</h3>

        <p>Most treatment costs are covered by a PRC, but there are some exceptions. </p>
        <p>In some countries, a resident of that country may need to pay a co-payment, also known as a patient contribution, towards the cost of their treatment. These payments are usually for services like GP or dentist consultations, prescriptions, or hospital stays. </p>
        <p>Depending on the country you're claiming treatment, you may need to pay for services that you would get for free on the NHS. You may still receive an invoice for a co-payment if you've not paid one.</p>
        <p>For more information on travelling in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, including what a PRC covers in the country you're visiting, check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">guidance on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

          <p>A PRC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs.</p>
